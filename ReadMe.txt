Geonosis Version 1.0

Geonosis is the beginning of what will become a fully automated graphically oriented database driven AJAX
Application Generator capable of allowing non-programmers to generate complete robust web based ColdFusion 
applications.

Geonosis uses an Object-Oriented Network Data Model that allows for ad-hoc data objects to be created and 
manipulated with relative ease.  Aside from the fact that such a data model is fairly advanced it is also
simple and elegant at the same time.

At this time, Geonosis is nothing more than a sample AJAX App that does nothing more than allow the various
Object-Oriented data model objects to be created, edited, linked and destroyed.

The Geonosis Object-Oriented Data Model consists of the following database tables:

* objectClassDefinitions - defined Classes or types of objects.
* objects - defines object instances.
* objectAttributes - defined attributes for object instances.
* objectLinks - defines links between object instances.

Scripts are included to allow databases to be created for SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005.

Geonosis works with both SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005.

Stay tuned for the fully functional AJAX Application Generator based on the Geonosis Engine - to be released soon.
